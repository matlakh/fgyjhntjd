            The 25-year-old gives us the lowdown on how she became a confident
            investor and how it’s possible to do so even on a student income.
          </p>
          <h3>Tell us about yourself!</h3>
          <p>
            I’m a med student originally from Gisborne, but currently finishing
            up my final year of placement in Christchurch. Outside of study and
            work, I love going on hikes with my cat (I take her out on a lead
            and she loves it!), learning how to roller skate, and dabbling in
            woodworking.
          </p>
          <h3>What’s your money story?</h3>
          <p>
            Growing up, I remember asking my parents questions like ‘how much
            does a house cost’ or ‘how much do you earn?’ and them telling me I
            was still young and to not worry about money. When I turned 15, all
            that changed, pretty rapidly. All of a sudden, my mum’s like “why
            don’t you have a savings account?” to which I replied, “what’s a
            saving’s account?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Around that time, my mum (my money hero) had just started learning
            about investing. Having grown up under a communist regime in the
            Czech Republic where people kept money under their pillows because
            nobody trusted the banks (her words), it’s incredible to see how far
            she’s come.
          </p>
          <p>
            She began with term deposits, then moved on to things like
            KiwiSaver, before she became a full-fledged investor. The more my
            mum learnt about investing over the years, the more she tried to
            convince me to start investing, too.
          </p>
          <h3>Tell us about your first time investing.</h3>
          <p>
            I was very hesitant about investing at first. When my mum first told
            me about it, I said I’d deal with that when I wasn’t working summer
            jobs to get by, and when medical school was done and dusted. But
            then in October 2018, my mum invited me to a workshop run by a local
            investment firm and everything changed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I remember being very nervous going to the event, thinking they
            wouldn’t take me or my money seriously. There were a lot of men in
            suits there—I really felt as if I didn’t belong. But when I finally
            managed to speak to one of the representatives, they made me feel
            really comfortable and helped me to make my first investment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within two weeks, there was a big dip in the market. But not long
            after, it rebounded. Seeing the share market fluctuate helped me get
            comfortable accepting this as a risk of investing.
          </p>

          <h3>What does your investment portfolio look like today?</h3>
          <p>
            I put 60% into Sharesies, 10% into my bank account, and 30% into a
            fund managed by an investment firm. I keep a pretty diversified
            portfolio. I invest in everything from freight to activewear; energy
            drinks through to travel brands.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think of myself as quite a passive investor. I have an automatic
            payment that goes out every week from my bank account into my
            Sharesies Wallet. I don’t tend to check my portfolio a lot because I
            think of it as a long-term investment, so the daily jumps and dips
            don’t matter a great deal to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I’m researching what to invest in, I check the one and five
            year forecasts of the company and ask myself: If I had put $100 into
            this company or fund five years ago, how much would I have now? Then
            I do the math on what it’d be if I had invested a thousand dollars.
          </p>
          <h3>
            How have your money attitudes and behaviours changed over time?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I went from thinking I didn’t have enough money to invest, to
            realising that the money I do have is worth investing. I’ve also
            changed my spending habits. Recently, I was scrolling through
            Instagram and saw some cute tights for a hundred dollars. Instead of
            impulse buying those tights, I did some research on the company and
            ended up buying their shares instead!
          </p>
          <p>
            I do the same whenever I feel the urge to buy coffee now, too.
            Basically, I will almost always buy shares in the company over a
            product any day.
          </p>

          <h3>What are your financial goals?</h3>
          <p>
            I want to buy a house in Christchurch in the near future, so I’m now
            educating myself on mortgages and how the housing market works.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anytime I’ve mentioned the idea of buying a house to someone, I’m
            always met with the spiel about how crazy house prices are right
            now. But when you look at house prices, they’ve gone up the same way
            share prices have, but no one says: ‘there’s no point investing in
            shares now because they’re so much more expensive than they were 10
            years ago’. People just buy them. I’m trying to approach the
            property ladder in a similar way. Sure, it would’ve been better to
            have bought a house five years ago, but I can’t go back in time. So
            I have to look toward the future and buy a property now if I can.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What would you say to someone who doesn’t think investing is for
            them?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I started with a thousand dollars. It was all I had saved up and I
            was worried the investment firm was going to laugh at me and tell me
            they didn’t want my petty money. When in fact, that thousand dollars
            was more than enough.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m a student living off summer earnings and a student allowance,
            and if I can do it, I think anyone can!

        </p>
        <h4>Applicable jurisdiction</h4>
        <p>
          The Service is provided to Australian resident investors from New
          Zealand. This means that the Service is regulated under New Zealand
          law. You will not have the same protections as if the Service was
          provided under Australian law and you may not have the same rights as
          New Zealand investors with respect to the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a complaint about the platform Service, your rights of
          recourse will be against Sharesies and will follow it’s complaints
          process.
        </p>
        <h4>Eligibility to open an account</h4>
        <p>You must be 18 years or older to hold an Account.</p>
        <h4>Foreign custodian</h4>
        <p>
          The money in your Wallet and Investments in your Account will be held
          on bare trust for you by Sharesies Nominee or another approved
          third-party, at our discretion. Sharesies Nominee is a New Zealand
          based entity responsible for holding client money and Investments. We
          also use a third-party custodian based in the US to hold US-listed
          Investments. Custodian entities are not regulated in Australia and not
          subject to Australian law requirements. This means we hold your money
          and Investments in accordance with our New Zealand law requirements,
          standard but you may not have remedies under New Zealand legislation.
          We don’t want anything to go wrong but if it does please let us know
          straight away at&nbsp;<a
            href="mailto:help@sharesies.co.nz"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >help@sharesies.co.nz</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your money and Investments are protected under a bare trust structure
          for you as the ultimate beneficial owner.
        </p>
        <h4>National Guarantee Fund</h4>
        <p>
          The Australian National Guarantee Fund does not apply to New Zealand
          or US-based investments acquired through the Platform.
        </p>
        <h4>Withholding tax</h4>
        <p>
          You’re responsible for your own tax obligations. Sharesies may make
          things easy by deducting withholding tax from Investment income made
          through the Service and pay to the relevant government tax authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          You do not have to provide us with your tax file number (“TFN”) and
          declining to do so is not an offence. If you fail to provide us with
          your correct TFN or notify us that you are eligible for an exemption
          from providing a TFN, we may not be able to provide all our Services
          to you.
        </p>
        <h4>Restricted offering</h4>
        <p>
          We may not be able to offer all Investments through the Service to
          Australian resident investors. The Service may also operate
          differently for Australian resident investors, or parts of the Service
          may not be accessible.
        </p>
        <h4>Transfer of Service</h4>
        <p>
          We may change how we provide this Service to Australian resident
          investors, including assigning rights under these terms and conditions
          to another Sharesies Group entity, third party or an approved
          custodian. We will notify you of any transfer of Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the extent anything in this Part 1A differs from the rest of the
          terms and conditions, the terms of Part 1A will prevail to the extent
          of the inconsistency.

        </h2>
        <p>
          Here are the steps you need to take to invest using our Service:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Open an Account</p></li>
          <li><p>Top up your Wallet</p></li>
          <li><p>Place an Order to buy or sell Investments</p></li>
          <li><p>Wait while your Order or FX Order is processed</p></li>
          <li><p>Check your Trade confirmations</p></li>
          <li><p>Continue to build your Portfolio</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="open-an-account">Open an Account</h3>
        <p>
          You can open an Account by following the instructions on the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must meet our criteria to open and keep your Account. You must
          complete all parts of the application. You confirm that any
          information you give us is true and complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may need to get more information from you. Until we have all of the
          information we need, we may suspend your access to or use of our
          Service—for example, you may not be able to access your Account, place
          an Order, or get money out from your Account.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don’t have to open your Account or provide any reasons for not
          doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your information changes at any time, you need to tell us straight
          away.
        </p>
        <h3 id="top-up-your-wallet">Top up your Wallet</h3>
        <p>
          To make an Investment, you’ll need to have funds in your Wallet. We
          may place requirements around what currency you need to top up your
          Wallet and we may impose minimum top up amounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may accept top-ups by bank transfer or by credit or debit card
          payment. We may charge a card processing fee and limit the amount you
          can top up by card.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can delay acting on your Orders until your money has arrived in
          your Wallet as cleared funds.
        </p>
        <h3 id="changing-currency">Changing currency</h3>
        <p>
          To exchange currency, log into your Account and follow the
          instructions to place an FX Order.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you place an FX Order, you’ll select the amount of currency you
          want to obtain (the ‘Buy Currency’) and the currency you will sell
          (the ‘Sell Currency’). FX Orders can incur a transaction fee
          (sometimes referred to as a currency exchange fee) which will be
          displayed before you submit an FX Order. The transaction fee will be
          deducted from the Sell Currency amount before the amount is exchanged.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exchange rate we display is sourced from third parties and is not
          final until you confirm your exchange order and receive confirmation
          of your order. If the exchange rate moves materially, you may receive
          an error screen and need to re-submit your FX Order.
        </p>
        <p>You will not be able to cancel your FX Order once submitted.</p>
        <p>
          FX Orders can be placed at any time. An FX Order placed on the weekend
          or a public holiday will process the following Business Day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Wallet balance may be updated to make the Buy Currency available
          to you before we have settled our obligations with Third-party
          Providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We provide the foreign currency service available through our Service.
          We separately transact with third parties in order to provide foreign
          currency to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not guarantee that we are able to provide you with currency or
          accept an FX Order, and we may cancel an FX Order or any resulting
          transaction for any reason (including where there are errors displayed
          in the Service). We may change, add or remove currencies that can be
          exchanged through our Service at any time without notice.

          Log into your Account to place an Order to buy or sell Investments.
          The types of Orders you can place on each Exchange or between types of
          Investments may differ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, when you place an Order to buy an Investment, you can
          choose to place a ‘market buy’ by entering the amount of money you
          want to invest, or a ‘limit order’ by entering the highest price
          you’re willing to pay per Share and the number of Shares you want to
          purchase. You’ll need to have at least the amount of money to buy the
          Investment in your Wallet before placing the Order
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally Investments are purchased in the currency applicable to the
          jurisdiction where the Investment is based/listed. You do not need to
          hold the same currency of the Investment before you place an Order.
          You can place the Order in the currency you already hold in your
          Wallet and we will exchange your currency at the same time (for
          example if you only hold NZD in your Wallet when placing an Order for
          US-listed Shares we will exchange your NZD before placing the Order).
          Where an Order to buy an Investment is placed and the currency
          exchange rate moves such that you no longer have enough currency to
          exchange to fulfil the purchase, the transaction may not proceed and
          you may receive an error screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, when you place an Order to sell an Investment, you can
          choose to place a ‘market sell’ by entering the dollar amount of
          shares you want to sell, or a ‘limit order’ by entering the lowest
          price you’re willing to receive per share and the number of shares you
          want to sell. You’ll need to have at least that number of relevant
          Shares or Units in your Portfolio to place the Order. The proceeds of
          a sold Investment will display in your Wallet in the currency
          applicable to the jurisdiction where the Investment is based/listed
          e.g. if you sell US-listed Shares, you will receive US dollars into
          your Wallet.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may change, add, or remove the Investments that are available to
          buy, sell, or hold through our Service, and the Exchanges available,
          at any time, without notice.
        </p>
        <h4>You can set auto-invest Orders</h4>
        <p>
          An auto-invest Order is a standing instruction to regularly repeat an
          Order to buy a particular Investment or group of Investments. You need
          to have enough money in your Wallet to buy the Investments, so it's a
          good idea to set up a recurring payment from your bank account to your
          Wallet. Auto-invest may not be available for all Investments or
          customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may cancel your auto-invest Order at any time, unless your
          auto-invest Order is being processed at that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may restrict the type of Investments you can auto-invest in, or the
          terms of auto-investment, at any time.
        </p>
        <h4>What happens when you place an Order to buy or sell Shares</h4>
        <p>
          If you place an Order to buy Shares, we’ll try to buy you either as
          many Shares (or fractions of a Share) as we can for the dollar value
          of your Order or the number of Shares (or fraction) you enter to buy
          (less any applicable transaction and currency exchange fees). If you
          place an Order to sell Shares, we’ll try to sell the number of Shares
          (or fractions) you enter to sell.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Share ‘Trade’ occurs where an Order to buy or sell Shares is filled
          by a corresponding Order to sell or buy. For NZ-listed Shares or ETFs,
          we place trades on the NZX in our capacity as a trading participant on
          your behalf. For US-listed Shares and ETFs, we have partnered with a
          US-based broker-dealer who places trades on the relevant Exchange on
          our behalf. We place Orders for ASX-listed Shares and ETFs onto the
          relevant Exchange via an Australian-based broker-dealer. Some
          Australian Investments are traded on more than one Exchange within
          Australia and your Order may be filled on either Exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Order to buy or sell Shares may be completed in whole or part
          almost immediately, or it may take hours, days, or weeks before your
          entire Order is completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your Order will require buying or selling a fraction of a Share, we
          may:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              buy or sell a whole Share to allocate you a fraction of the Share
              or the money for selling your fraction of the Share. To do this,
              we can act as principal to make the trade, which means we're
              buying or selling (in part) in our own name. If we're acting as
              principal for a fraction of a Share, your Order has priority.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              for US Shares, we may buy or sell the fraction of a Share where
              possible with a third party broker-dealer. Another person
              (including us) may own the remaining fraction of the same Share.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We may trade with you ourselves in accordance with our best price
          policy.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What happens when you place an Order to buy or sell Units of a Managed
          fund
        </h4>
        <p>
          If you place an Order to buy Units of a Managed fund, we’ll try to buy
          you as many Units (or fractions of a Unit) as we can for the dollar
          value of your Order at the time your Order is completed. If you place
          an Order to sell Units, we’ll try to sell the number of Units (or
          fractions of a Unit) you enter to sell.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you place an Order to buy or sell Units, we can pool your money or
          Units with other investors.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Managed fund ‘Trade’ occurs when your Order to buy or sell Units is
          completed by the Managed fund Provider.
        </p>
        <h4>Exchange trading hours</h4>
        <p>
          Where you place an Order for NZ Investments or Australia Investments,
          we may hold the Order until the relevant Exchange opens for trading.
          We may also participate in auction phases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where you place an Order of US Investments, we place the trade with
          our US-based broker-dealer. The US-based broker-dealer will place
          Orders on the relevant Exchange when the market opens.
        </p>
        <h4>Sometimes you can cancel your Order or FX Order</h4>
        <p>
          We don’t guarantee that you’ll be able to cancel an Order or FX Order.
          You may be able to cancel an Order that is shown as “pending” in your
          Account. You typically can’t cancel a Managed funds Order once it is
          shown as “processing” in your Account.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may be able to cancel a Share Order (or any part of a Share Order)
          that hasn't become a Trade.
        </p>
        <p>You can't cancel any part of an Order that has become a Trade.</p>
        <h4>Wait while your Order or FX Order is processed</h4>
        <p>
          Orders for different Investments process in different ways. The
          processing date and time for each Order and FX Order will depend on
          our requirements, and the requirements of third parties (including our
          third party broker-dealers and relevant Managed fund Providers).
        </p>
        <p>
          The price we show in the Service when you place an Order may not be
          the final price you pay. We show pricing data provided by third
          parties, and this data can be delayed.
        </p>
        <p>You agree that we may:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              complete a buy or sell Order or FX Order with ourselves or with
              others
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>act for you as both a buyer or seller</p></li>
          <li><p>act for the corresponding seller or buyer</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>be the buyer or seller for our own account in any Trade</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
          We will give your Managed fund Order to the Managed fund Provider
        </h4>
        <p>
          We usually process your Orders for Managed funds each Trading Day at
          around 12.30pm NZT. Daily cut-off times may vary. If we receive your
          Order after the relevant cut-off time, we’ll usually process it on the
          next Trading Day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Order may be delayed for reasons beyond our control for example,
          the Managed fund Provider’s systems may be down or Investments
          unavailable. The actual price is set by the Managed fund Provider at
          the time they complete your Order.
        </p>
        <h4>We will bring your Share Order to the market</h4>
        <p>
          You authorise us to put your Share Order for NZ-listed Shares and ETFs
          into the NZX. You may either put your Share Order into the NZX with a
          price limit that you set or with a price limit that we determine in
          our discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
          For US-listed Shares and ASX-listed Shares and ETFs, you authorise us
          to place your Share Order with our third party broker-dealers. Where
          your Share Order is below a specific threshold, we may transact with
          you ourselves in accordance with our best price policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes your Order for Shares may process almost immediately and
          become a Trade, but it can take longer for several reasons. For
          example, you might have placed your Order outside of the Trading Day,
          your Order may be waiting on a corresponding buyer or seller in the
          market, the Exchange may have suspended trading, or third-party
          systems may be unavailable or experiencing delays.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we receive your Share Orders (and they are to be placed on an
          Exchange):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              during the Trading Day, we’ll usually put your Share Order into
              the market as soon as we reasonably can
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              outside of the Trading Day, we’ll usually put your Share Order
              into the market at the start of the next Trading Day
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              where an Exchange is down or an Exchange has suspended trading,
              we’ll usually put Share Orders into the market when the Exchange
              is back up and running, or has started trading again.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With any Share Trade, the Share price when the Trade completes may be
          different from the Share price shown when you placed your Share Order.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may not put Share Orders into the market during pre-open or
          pre-close market sessions or other auction phases. You agree that we
          may at our discretion:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>accumulate or bundle Orders</p></li>
          <li><p>delay acting on your Orders</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>
              delay Orders to allow for ‘crossings’ (as defined in the NZX
              Rules)
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can override our discretion to accumulate, bundle or delay your
          Order by cancelling your Order before it is processing.
        </p>
        <h4>Your Orders, FX Orders or Trades may be delayed or cancelled</h4>
        <p>
          We may refuse to act on, delay, or cancel all or part of your Order,
          FX Order or Trade and we don't have to give you reasons for doing so.
          For example, it might make sense for us to refuse to act on, delay, or
          cancel an Order, FX Order or Trade (or any part of an Order, FX Order
          or Trade) if:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              we're concerned that the Order, FX Order or Trade could breach our
              terms or the Law
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              we believe that the Order, FX Order or Trade contains, or is based
              on, an obvious error
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              a Share Order (or any part of the Share Order) remains unfulfilled
              on the market for some time (we’ll usually cancel the unfulfilled
              Order or part after 30 days, but we might notify you of a
              different time frame)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              an Exchange has recommended or required cancellation, or the
              cancellation is otherwise permitted or required under the Exchange
              Rules
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              a third party broker-dealer restricts access to trade in an
              Investment
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              we, or a third party, are concerned to maintain market stability
              or system integrity
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You agree that you will pay us any cancellation fee, levy, or other
          cost that we need to pay for an Order, FX Order or Trade that was
          cancelled because of an error in your instruction or an error
          otherwise caused by you. If you become aware of any error in any
          instruction, Order, FX Order or Trade, you must immediately let us
          know and take all reasonable steps to reduce the chance of you or
          anyone else suffering any loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can set and amend limits for your Orders or FX Orders for example,
          we may from time to time limit the dollar value, number of Shares or
          Units, frequency, or type of Orders you can make.
        </p>
        <h4>Check your Trade confirmations</h4>
        <p>
          We’ll send you confirmation that your Trade has completed. For Share
          Orders, we send a ‘contract note’. If a Share Order is partially
          completed on a Trading Day, then you will receive a confirmation for
          only that part of the Order that has completed. You will receive
          confirmation when more parts of your Order are completed on following
          Trading Days. You agree that we can send you contract notes
          electronically through the Service. You must check that the details of
          the Trade are correct. If you believe the Trade is incorrect in any
          way, you need to let us know straight away.
        </p>
        <p>
          You’ll receive the benefits of holding an Investment from when we
          receive confirmation that your Order has been completed. At that
          point, the Investment will form part of the valuation of your
          Portfolio.
        </p>
        <h4>Settlement</h4>
        <p>
          Settlement is when ownership is transferred and we receive the
          Investments or money to hold for you. We're not responsible for any
          delay in settling an Order or FX Order resulting from circumstances
          beyond our control, or the failure of any other person or party
          (including you) to perform all the necessary steps to complete your
          Order or FX Order on the settlement date. We carry out trades for you
          solely as your agent and may act also as principal to a trade. We may
          update your Portfolio shortly after the Trade has completed but before
          settlement to reflect your completed Order. However, we may need to
          wait until the Exchange or Third-Party Provider has settled the Trade.
        </p>
        <h4>When you’ll get the money for a completed sell Order</h4>
        <p>
          We’ll credit the money you receive for a completed Order to sell
          Managed funds to your Wallet (less any applicable transaction fee) as
          soon as we reasonably can. Settlement for Managed funds normally takes
          2 to 5 Trading Days.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may credit the money you receive for a completed Order to sell
          Shares to your Wallet shortly after the Trade has completed. However,
          we may need to wait until the Exchange or Third-Party Provider has
          settled the Trade and Sharesies Nominee has received the money from
          the clearing house or Third-Party Provider.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What happens if you don't give us what we need to settle a Trade
        </h4>
        <p>
          If we're unable to deliver Investments for a Trade by the necessary
          time because you do something you shouldn’t do, or don’t do something
          you should do, you must immediately meet any direct or indirect
          charge, cost, or expense that we incur as a result.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't deliver relevant documents or information by the time
          needed for any Trade, we may:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>cancel the Trade if possible</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>
              buy back, sell, or take possession of the relevant Investments
              that are the subject of the Trade
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              take possession of any Investments that we don't already hold that
              are the subject of the Trade
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>sell any other Investments in our control or possession</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              register a financing statement on the Personal Property Securities
              Register over the Investments in the Trade
            </p>

          When you buy and sell NZ-listed Shares and ETFs through us, we're
          authorised by NZX to act as ‘clearing participant’ to clear and settle
          the Trade under the NZX Rules. We may also use a third-party clearing
          participant and, if we do, we’ll let you know their details.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the NZX Rules, so that we can clear and settle your Trade, you
          agree that we ‘step into your shoes’ with all of your rights and
          obligations as a buyer (or seller). This is called a ‘novation’ of the
          contract.
        </p>
        <p>
          To do this, you give to us full and exclusive rights, power, and
          authority as your agent under the NZX Rules (including to bind you to
          the C&amp;S Rules), and you authorise us to apply money or Shares held
          for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          CHO, owned by NZX, stands in the middle of the Trade as a central
          counterparty. This means we don’t have any direct contact with the
          actual buyer or seller on the other side of the trade. We only deal
          with CHO, and CHO only deals with us. Because of this, you don’t have
          any rights against or obligations to CHO to clear and settle the
          trade.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although we do have rights against the NZX Entities involved in a
          Trade, their liability is limited or excluded by the NZX Rules (in
          particular, section 8 of the C&amp;S Rules and section 9 of the
          Depository Rules).
        </p>
        <h4>We can use the NZX depository service for your Share Trades</h4>
        <p>
          When you buy and sell NZ-listed Shares through us, we may settle the
          transaction using the depository operated by CDO, and its Depository
          Nominee, which are both owned by NZX Limited.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we use the depository, CDO and the Depository Nominee will treat
          Sharesies Nominee as if it is the sole beneficial owner of money or
          Shares they are holding. Except as ordered by a court or required
          under their own Depository Rules, CDO and the Depository Nominee don't
          have to recognise your interest in that money or those Shares. This
          means you don’t have a direct right or claim against them, only
          through and against us.
        </p>
        <p>
          CDO and the Depository Nominee must, however, hold that money or those
          Shares on trust for Sharesies Nominee. This protects the money and
          Shares against a claim by CDO or any other market participant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless, Sharesies Nominee holds its interest in the money or
          Shares with the Depository Nominee on bare trust for you as the
          ultimate beneficial owner.
        </p>
        <h4>How we clear and settle your US-listed Share Trades</h4>
        <p>
          We use a third-party broker-dealer to trade, clear and settle
          US-listed and ASX-listed Shares and ETFs.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may contract with you ourselves for US-listed Share and ETF Trades
          below a threshold and these trades may not need to be cleared and
          settled through the US-based broker-dealer.
        </p>
        <h4>Continue to build your Portfolio</h4>
        <p>
          You might get income, tax credits, or dividends from your Investments.
          We will pay any income that we collect for you from your Investments
          (less tax, fees, and costs) into your Wallet as distributions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Service doesn’t currently provide an option for money you make
          from distributions to be automatically reinvested. Instead, we will
          pay distributions into your Wallet and hold them there until you give
          us more instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might get other rights from your Investments, including rights in
          ‘corporate actions’ or rights to vote. Corporate actions are things
          like distributions, dividends, entitlement offers (rights issues),
          voting rights, re-organisations of capital, and capital returns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some corporate actions are passive, meaning you do not need to vote in
          order to participate. Other corporate actions you may be eligible to
          vote on or participate in. You acknowledge that we don't have to
          forward to you, or take action on any, corporate action communications
          we receive about Investments in your Portfolio. We may, however,
          forward such items to you and may take such steps as we consider (at
          our discretion) to be in the best interests of all affected Sharesies
          customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your Portfolio includes a fraction of a Share, we can choose
          whether and how to vote for that Share—typically you won’t get to vote
          for the fraction of the Share.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may offer you the ability to participate in alternative forms of
          investment through our Service. We act as neither the issuer nor the
          offeror in regards to these investments.
        </p>
        <h4>You'll need to pay tax on your Investments</h4>
        <p>
          You’re responsible for your own tax obligations. At Sharesies we make
          things easy by paying withholding tax on income earned from shares you
          hold through our Service unless, for example, you come under FIF rules
          or you trade Investments from time to time. For more information,
          check out our help centre articles.
        </p>
        <h4>Taxes on PIEs are different and we can help with that</h4>
        <p>
          If you're investing in Managed funds that are NZ portfolio investment
          entities (PIEs), we may act as a PIE investor proxy (sometimes called
          a PIP) for tax purposes. This means that when you invest in a PIE, we
          will be holding the Investment on your behalf for tax purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          You acknowledge that we will undertake tax compliance for your PIE
          Investments through the Service. We may be required to collect certain
          tax information from you and provide it to the PIE for them to meet
          their tax obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must provide us with your IRD number and keep us notified of your
          prescribed investor rate (PIR). If you don't notify us of your PIR and
          your IRD number, we may use the default rate of 28%.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you notify a PIR that is lower than your correct rate, you will
          need to include your PIE income in your tax return and pay any tax
          shortfall (including penalties or interest) to Inland Revenue. If the
          default rate or your notified PIR is higher than your correct rate,
          you won't get a refund of any overpaid tax.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may sell any Investment or part of an Investment in your Account
          and keep the money we receive from the sale to pay PIE tax for you.
        </p>
        <h4>
          You’ll need to keep up to date with fees charged by your Investment
          providers
        </h4>
        <p>
          Managed fund Providers and other Investment providers’ (including
          ETFs) management fees and expenses may be built into the value of the
          Investments they offer. You are responsible for keeping up to date
          with these fees and expenses that form part of the Investment. You are
          typically not charged these separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specific types of Investments may also charge additional periodic or
          one-off fees as a consequence of continuing to hold an interest in the
          Investment. You are responsible for keeping up to date with any
          additional fees and for meeting this cost.
        </p>
        <h4>
          You can ask us to pay money from your Wallet to your Designated
          Account
        </h4>
        <p>
          If you want to take some of the money out of your Wallet, log into
          your Account and follow the instructions to ask us to pay the money to
          your Designated Account.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will only pay your money to your Designated Account. We may impose
          restrictions around which bank account can be a Designated Account. We
          can set a maximum daily amount that you can ask us to pay to your
          Designated Account and we can change the maximum amount without
          notice. If your Wallet contains less than $0.01 then you will not be
          able to withdraw that amount and upon closure of your Account we will
          retain this small amount.
        </p>
        <h4>We apply rounding</h4>
        <p>We may round values in your Wallet or Portfolio.</p>
        <h4>Fractional trading</h4>
        <p>Fractional Share trading comes with its own rights and risks.</p>
        <p>
          Shares available for fractional trading and the types of Orders that
          can be placed may be restricted by third parties. Fractional Shares
          may have different rights from a whole Share interest. Fractional
          holdings are only available to be sold, and cannot be transferred
          outside of the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fractional holdings may be rounded to the nearest 8 decimal places,
          which means you may receive $0.00 cents upon sale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally you won’t get to vote for the fraction of the Share and we
          may choose whether and how to vote for the whole share. Fractional
          Shares may be entitled to participate in corporate actions (e.g. share
          splits), and if so, we will endeavour to allocate the portion accruing
          to you in proportion to your fractional interest. We may not be able
          to support participation of fractional portions in some corporate
          actions.
        </p>
        <h2 id="3-investing-isnt-always-straightforward">
          3. Investing isn’t always straightforward
        </h2>
        <p>
          All investments and currency can go down in value as well as up. We’re
          not responsible if you lose money for example, if the value of your
          Investments goes down or a currency devalues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currency exchange risk is the risk that the exchange rate may
          detrimentally change between currencies. By holding different
          currencies and Investments based in other jurisdictions you take on
          the risk that you may not receive back the same amount of money that
          you originally invested.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, you could get back less than you invest. Any returns will
          vary over time, so income is variable and not guaranteed. The values
          of your Investments can be influenced by what’s happening in the
          market or general economy for example, a property downturn or a new
          government budget.
        </p>
        <h4>Occasionally, the Service won’t be available</h4>
        <p>
          We work hard to provide the best Service we can, but we don’t promise
          it will be perfect all of the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may suspend the operation of our Service in part or in full if we
          consider it necessary. We may, for example, need to suspend the
          Service for technical reasons, regulatory reasons, in emergencies, in
          periods of exceptional trading activity, when we decide it is sensible
          for our or your protection, to ensure the continued availability of
          other services, or because Third-Party Provider systems are
          unavailable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Occasionally, we may need to suspend the Service to maintain or
          upgrade our systems. From time to time, we may ask you to install
          updates and upgrades.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don’t guarantee that our Service will be 100% secure,
          uninterrupted, or error-free. To the maximum extent permitted by Law,
          we provide our Service on an ‘as is’ basis, without any warranty of
          any kind. That means you use our Service at your own risk. It also
          means that we exclude and disclaim all implied warranties, to the
          extent that we legally can.
        </p>
        <h4>We don’t provide personalised advice</h4>
        <p>
          We don’t provide any personalised advice or recommendations. Any
          information we make available to you does not take into account your
          particular investment objectives, financial situation, or investment
          needs. None of the information we provide can be taken as personalised
          investment, financial, or tax advice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any information that we may give you through the Service is subject to
          our terms, and this won’t create any warranty that isn’t expressly
          given in our terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re unsure whether or not a particular Investment is right for
          you, you should get advice from a personal financial adviser.
        </p>
        <h4>We don’t offer some investment options</h4>
        <p>At the moment, our Service doesn’t allow you to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              add some existing Investments that you hold outside of the Service
              to your Portfolio
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              transfer some Investments from your Portfolio outside of the
              Service
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              buy or sell Shares using your own common shareholder number (CSN)
              through the Service
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              transfer currency you hold outside of the Service to your Wallet
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              transfer some currencies from your Wallet outside of the Service
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We hope to be able to provide some of these services in the future —
          watch this space.
        </p>
        <h4>We're not the issuer or manager of the Investments</h4>
        <p>
          We're not the issuer or manager of any of the Investments available
          through the Service and we don't accept any responsibility for the
          performance of any Investments.
        </p>
        <h4>We don’t provide Portfolio management</h4>
        <p>
          We don't provide any discretionary investment management service for
          your Investments. We act as your agent on your instructions under our
          terms.
        </p>
        <h4>Sometimes you may not be able to buy or sell Investments</h4>
        <p>
          Most Shares have buyers and sellers. However, not every Share will
          have a buyer or seller at the price and time you want to buy or sell.
          This may mean you need to hold onto Shares longer than you want to, or
          that you can’t buy Shares when you're ready to buy.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may also be suspended or delayed from selling the Units in a
          Managed fund under the Managed fund's terms. You can read more about
          this in the offer documents for the Managed fund, available through
          the Service.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Sometimes you won't be able to trade Shares because Exchange trading
          is suspended
        </h4>
        <p>
          Under certain trading conditions, we or a third party may not be able
          to enter, clear, or settle a Share Trade. This may occur, for example,
          when prices move very quickly in a short period of time, or an
          Exchange or third-party suspends or restricts trading.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What happens if Sharesies or brokers involved in your trade become
          insolvent or default on their obligations
        </h4>
        <p>
          If we become insolvent or otherwise materially default on our
          obligations (or the other brokers involved in your transaction do),
          your Orders, FX Orders or Trades could be cancelled. However,
          Sharesies Nominee will never use money, Investments, or other property
          held for you for the benefit of itself, us, or any other person.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we become insolvent or otherwise materially default on our
          obligations, your Wallet and Portfolio will be protected from the
          claims of general creditors, including any bank holding your money and
          CDO for any money or Shares held in the NZX depository account.
        </p>
        <p>
          If our third-party currency exchange provider becomes insolvent, or
          otherwise materially defaults on its obligations, we may cancel your
          FX Orders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our third-party US broker-dealer holds all Investments in a separate
          account which is not available to the claims of general creditors.
        </p>
        <h4>We may provide you with Market Information</h4>
        <p>
          We provide Market Information such as pricing information, news, data,
          calculations, and investor information (including product disclosure
          statements) through the Service. Some of this Market Information is
          from third parties; some we create. This Market Information may be

          4. How we keep your money, Investments, and information secure
        </h2>
        <p>
          We will keep detailed records of all money in your Wallet and
          Investments in your Account. The money in your Wallet and Investments
          in your Account will be held on bare trust for you by Sharesies
          Nominee or another approved third-party custodian, at our direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharesies Nominee is a non-trading company that exists to hold our
          clients’ money and Investments secure and separate from our own
          (although we may hold a buffer of our own money in the same account).
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Investments may be pooled with the Investments of other clients.
          As a result, your holding may not be individually identifiable on the
          relevant Investment issuer register for example, your Investment may
          be pooled with others and held in the name of Sharesies Nominee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your money may be held in ‘pooled accounts’, which means your money
          may be held in bank account(s) in the name of Sharesies Nominee along
          with the money of other people using the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          The banks we use are independent of us, and we don't accept
          responsibility for any default or delay in the distribution of money
          as a result of their failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we're unable to identify which Account money should be credited to,
          we reserve the right to return money to the source it came from,
          subject to normal banking clearance times.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you or we close your Account, we will make every reasonable
          effort to pay out any remaining balances that accrue after your
          Account is closed. If we're holding any money that becomes unclaimed
          money, we may account for that money under the Unclaimed Money Act
          1971.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we refer to your money in this section, we mean money we are
          holding for you that we’ve received either from you or from a third
          party for you. This may include money you’ve added to your Wallet or
          money received from your Investment. This excludes any fees or other
          charges you have paid or owe to us that is our money.

          such activity, including money laundering and financial crime. We can
          refuse, cancel, or void (as appropriate) any deposit or Investments
          for your Account if we suspect that a card payment was obtained or

        <h4>You are responsible for the use of your Account</h4>
        <p>
          We will always assume we're dealing with you. You may not use an
          Account on behalf of another person or permit another person to use
          your Account.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for any activity that occurs on your Account. We
          are entitled to assume and rely on any instruction we receive through
          your Account as being a valid instruction from you. We are not
          required to verify your instructions.

        <ul>
          <li><p>changing your password regularly</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>

          before it reaches your Wallet.
        </p>
        <p>
          FX Orders can incur a fee which will be displayed before you submit an
          FX Order. The fee will be deducted from the Sell Currency amount
          before the amount is exchanged.
        </p>
        <p>
          The amount of the fee may differ depending on the size of the FX Order
          or Order, and a fee may not be charged at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you subscribe to certain add-on services (e.g. NZX market depth),
          a subscription fee may be charged. Any applicable subscription fee,
          including any auto-renewal and cancellation terms will be advised to
          you when you select the add-on services for your Account. You can
          cancel any add-on services at any time before the relevant renewal
          date within your Account settings. We don't provide refunds or credits
          for any payments made in advance.
        </p>
        <p>You can find more information about our fees on our Website.</p>
        <h4>We make money from interest</h4>
        <p>
          Money we receive from you or a third party for your benefit, which
          includes money in your Wallet before it’s invested or withdrawn, may
          gain interest from our bank where it is deposited. You agree that we
          can keep that interest as part of the fees for using the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          You're not paid any interest on money in your Wallet (or otherwise
          held by the Service for you).
        </p>
        <h4>Sometimes we make money from third parties</h4>
        <p>
          Managed fund Providers or other investment providers may pay us a fee
          or commission for making their Investments available through the
          Service. This is at no additional cost to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third parties may pay us to provide them with services, such as
          carrying out research and development, or providing advertising
          opportunities.
        </p>
        <h4>How you can pay our subscription fees for add-on services</h4>
        <p>
          You have the option to pay our subscription fees for add-on services
          (e.g. NZX market depth) from money in your Wallet or by using card
          payment preferences you select for your Account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your subscription for any add-on services will be charged in advance
          annually or monthly (as applicable) via your selected payment method.
          In some cases, your payment date may change for example, if your
          payment method has not successfully settled.
        </p>
        <h4>What happens when you owe us money</h4>
        <p>
          If you owe us money, you agree that we can take any one, or
          combination of, the following:
        </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              direct Sharesies Nominee to pay us using the money in your Wallet,
              including converting currency into another currency to meet any
              obligation
            </p>

            <p>
              direct Sharesies Nominee to sell or otherwise deal with
              Investments in your Account, and to pay us using the proceeds
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>set off any money you owe us against money we owe you</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>

            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              immediately cancel or suspend any of your Orders without any
              responsibility to you
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              take legal action against you to recover any debt and any costs
              and expenses we incur in recovering the debt
            </p>

          <li>

              days of being notified in writing to do so
            </p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              we're required to close your Account or the Service by any

          <li><p>you breach our code of conduct</p></li>

          four bullet points above, you will pay us any costs and expenses
          associated with closing your Account, and we will not be liable to you
          for any loss you suffer as a result of us closing your Account.
        </p>
        <h4>
          We can close your Account for any reason after giving you 14 days’
          notice
        </h4>
        <p>
          In addition to the right to close your Account set out above (and in
          our specific terms), we may also close your Account or the Service for
          any other reason by giving you&nbsp;<b>at least 14 days’</b
          >&nbsp;written notice.
        </p>
        <h4>What happens when your Account is closed</h4>
        <p>
          Whether you close your Account or we close your Account, all of the
          following applies.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Unless specifically prohibited, we will complete pending or

              all outstanding amounts owing to us.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Unless we agree otherwise with you in writing, we may sell, deal
              with, or withdraw your Investments and pay the net proceeds (after
              deducting fees and any other amounts owing to us) to you. We may
              require you to convert outstanding currency balances into a single
              currency before transferring the money to your Designated Account.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We may (but are not obliged to) transfer Investments or currency
              to you, or we may agree to continue to hold Investments for you,

          <li>
            <p>
              If your Wallet contains less than $0.01 then you will not be able

              retain this small amount.

        <h4>We can make changes to our terms</h4>
        <p>
          We can change our terms, from time to time, by giving you notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we make a change to our terms that is likely to have a material
          negative impact on you, we will generally give you&nbsp;<b
            >at least 14 days’ notice</b
          >. However, we may give less notice in special circumstances for
          example, if we're required to make a change for regulatory or legal
          reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of our ‘paperless service’, we can give you notice by direct
          communication (such as email, text message, or a message when you sign
          in to access the Service), or by showing a general message via the
          Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don't need to give notice of changes that benefit you, don't
          materially reduce the benefit of the relevant Service to you, or are
          incidental changes (such as clarity, drafting, and typographical
          amendments) which may take effect immediately and will be available on
          the Sharesies Website.
        </p>
        <p>
          By continuing to access or use the Service after the effective date of
          any change, you have accepted the change. If you don’t want to accept
          any proposed change, you should notify us immediately, stop using the
          Service, and close your Account.
        </p>
        <h4>We can assign, delegate, and use third parties</h4>
        <p>
          We can appoint any person (whether connected to Sharesies or not) to
          advise on or perform any of our functions or responsibilities under
          our terms. We will satisfy ourselves that anyone we delegate any of
          our functions or responsibilities to is competent to carry out those
          functions and responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may transfer any of our rights and obligations under these terms in
          whole or in part to anyone. Any member of the Sharesies Group is
          entitled to enforce provisions of our terms, which apply to it as if
          it were a party to the contract.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can’t assign your rights to your Account (including any money or
          Investments) or use of the Service to anyone else without our prior
          written consent.
        </p>
        <h4>More about our terms</h4>
        <p>
          There might be different or extra terms and conditions that apply for
          certain customers, accounts, or services that are provided or made
          available to you at the time, and you agree to be bound by those as
          well. If specific terms and conditions apply to a particular customer,
          account, product, or service, and they are inconsistent with these
          terms and conditions, then the specific terms and conditions will
          apply. For example, see our ‘Kids Account Terms and Conditions’, ‘Gift
          Code Terms and Conditions’, and ‘Refer a Friend Terms and Conditions’.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any of our terms are inconsistent with any Law, then the Law will
          apply. Other terms may also be implied by Law.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it turns out that part of these terms can't be enforced, then that
          part will be removed or edited as little as possible, and the rest of
          the terms will continue to apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we don’t insist that you perform your obligations under our terms,
          it doesn’t mean you don’t have to. Similarly, if we don’t enforce our
          rights under our terms, or we delay in doing so, it doesn’t mean we’ve
          given up those rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our rights under this Agreement survive even when your Account is
          closed, or you’ve stopped using the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our terms are governed by New Zealand Law, and the Courts of New
          Zealand have exclusive jurisdiction if there’s a dispute.
        </p>
        <h4>How to read our terms</h4>
        <p>
          Headings are provided only to make these terms easier to read and
          understand. The fact that we wrote these headings won’t affect their
          interpretation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where we’ve provided examples in these terms to help explain what we
          mean, those may not be all possible examples.
        </p>
